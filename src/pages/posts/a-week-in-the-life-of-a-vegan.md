‘What do you actually eat?’

One of the most common questions I get when people ask about going vegan (I’m choosing to ignore the questions about where I get my protein from).

I was the same at the start. I had consigned myself to a life of lettuce leaves and tomatoes.

How wrong I was. I’ve found it much easier than expected – there’s something very definite about it. 

If you’re on a diet and avoiding certain foods it only takes one setback and the floodgates usually open. When you flick that switch in your mind after going vegan those temptations are gone – excluding things from your diet entirely is easier than just deciding not to eat some foods for a month or two.

Lifestyle change beats dieting every time.

I wanted to actually try and answer the question from the start of this post (and plan some diet clean-up for January – you can still eat some junk food on a vegan diet), so here goes with what a typical week’s eating will look like (I’ll update with links to recipes over the next few weeks).

## Monday
### Breakfast
Porridge & oat milk with flax seeds, chia seeds and maple syrup. Throw some vegan granola on top and add blueberries & caramelised banana. I wasn’t a fan of porridge in the past, but this would convert any non-believer.

### Lunch
Simple salad in a wrap – vegan mayonnaise is a revelation.

### Dinner
Brown rice and vegetable stir fry (peppers, onions, carrots and broccoli) – usually mixed with soy sauce, but you could mix some curry through as well.

## Tuesday
### Breakfast
Blueberry pancakes with maple syrup. Who knew flax seed could replace eggs? Oat milk replaces cows milk for these too.

### Lunch
Make a little bit extra of the brown rice and stir fry from the night before and you’ve got yourself a lunch as well.

### Dinner
Boiled potatoes, broccoli, green beans, carrots, parsnips and turnip (mashing the latter 3 together with some vegan butter and salt takes me back to my granny’s kitchen many moons ago – I think / hope I picked up some of my cooking skills there).

## Wednesday
### Breakfast
Porridge; same as Monday.

### Lunch
Baked potato and beans.

### Dinner
Pasta mixed with chopped tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, onions, peppers and coconut milk. Topped with a little vegan cheese.

## Thursday
### Breakfast
Banana, apple, orange.

### Lunch
Pasta from Wednesday night’s dinner.

### Dinner
Thursday night is pizza night – a good batch of dough (water, flour, salt and baking powder) can make about 8 bases – freeze some for the weeks ahead. Add some homemade chips and you’ve got the perfect fakeaway.

## Friday
### Breakfast
Porridge again.

### Lunch
Salad wrap.

### Dinner
Vegan curry with brown rice.

## Saturday
### Breakfast
Blueberry pancakes with banana.

### Lunch
Vegetable stir-fry with soy sauce or Katsu curry – you could add some rice here (and if I’m doing a long run on a Sunday I normally would) but I like to keep carbs in check on the weekend as it’s easy to get carried away.

### Dinner
Baked potato with salad and broccoli.

## Sunday
### Breakfast
Porridge – great slow-release energy food before a long run on a Sunday; I’ll aim to have this about 2 hours before I head out.

### Lunch
Burritos – keep some of the vegetable stir fry from Saturday’s lunch and mix in with some rice, chuck it in a wrap and you’ve got a good recovery meal for after Sunday’s run.

### Dinner
Veg overload – roast potatoes, carrots, parsnips & turnip mash, broccoli, green beans and vegan gravy.

## Vegan snacks
No real surprises here – fruit, nuts and raisins galore.

Most supermarkets have a good spread of vegan chocolate, crisps and popcorn, but I’m going to knock those on the head for January.

## Hidden benefits of being a vegan
I definitely had an advantage in that I liked lots of fruit and veg before going vegan – I didn’t have to force myself to eat broccoli or lettuce. I can see how if you’re not used to eating those types of foods that it would be a bigger challenge.

One thing I have noticed is that you learn how to cook vegetables better and make them more tasty. They’re no longer the sideshow that are boiled to death and you have a tiny spoonful beside your steak or chicken – when they’re the main event you put a little more effort into cooking them right. 

I’ll leave you with one final thing to consider.

One unintended side effect of going vegan is that it makes it a lot easier to cut weight. This is probably down to a few things – you can eat as much veg as you want and you’ll not really gain much weight. Veganism also forces you to cut out a lot of sweets, crisps and chocolate (there are vegan alternatives available but you won’t get them in every shop, which makes moderation a little easier), which will do no harm in the weight loss department.

If you’re not fussed on going vegan but want to lose a few Christmas pounds, try following a vegan diet for January only. You’ll get a much better idea of whether it’s for you or not and if you can lose a few pounds in the process, then all the better.
